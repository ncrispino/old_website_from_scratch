FIRST: finish project (interactive bar graph; possibly make python run and upload online)
---prob need django for this; should get further in the html tutorial to do this; stick with what I got now


Then:
- Make search bar WORK
- make nav-bar work when browser is zoomed in
- make sure everything's accessible (tags)
