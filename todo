FIRST: finish project (interactive bar graph; possibly make python run and upload online)
---prob need django for this; should get further in the html tutorial to do this; stick with what I got now

        use heroku?

https://podcasters.spotify.com/blog/get-the-full-podcast-picture-with-spotifys-new-and-improved-charts
https://podcastcharts.byspotify.com/ (can just scrape from here, not Chartable)

1. Create table for CSVs
2. Make partisan_database categorization (put in csv?) searchable
3. edit writing and finalize
4. possibly run the code online; possibly switch from chartable to spotify charts
5. do class stuff

Then:
- Make search bar WORK
- make nav-bar work when browser is zoomed in
- make sure everything's accessible (tags)

*** note: the WSJ and the WSJ & Gimlet are categorized differently
also neither stuff should be categorized

Also...
  - find out how many days each podcast has been in the top 50 since my start date. Possibly put in tables.
