## Hello!
Welcome to my website! I'll be making posts answering interesting questions in political science or economics. Mainly, I'll be using Python, specifically Numpy/Matplotlib/Pandas to create dataframes and graphs that nicely illustrate certain phenomena. I don't know too much, and am still a novice at data science-style coding, but I'll try my best to explore the concepts I'm interested in. There shouldn't be too much statistics or machine learning used (not currently, at least); most of the important information will be based in visualizations.

**Thanks for visiting!**
