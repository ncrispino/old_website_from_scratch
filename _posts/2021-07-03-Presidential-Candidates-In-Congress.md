In the 2020 democratic presidential primary, there was an influx of candidates, with everyone claiming this election was the most important in their lifetimes and only they had the power to beat Donald Trump. Of the [29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries) total candidates, 12 were running while currently serving in Congress (during the 116th session, which [ran from](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/DatesofSessionsofCongress.htm) January 3rd, 2019 to January 3rd 2021, excluding recesses). Of the [237 democrats in the House and 48 in the Senate](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45583.pdf) (including independents who caucus with the democrats), around 4.2% were running for Congress. This is not an insignificant number, as candidates who have great levels of influence can possible cede ground to other party members/other parties during their time campaigning. This post is meant to analyze the Congressional actions of these 12 presidential candidates during their time running for the nomination. By comparing this period (and the 116th congress as a whole, when most candidates began their campaign) to other periods in Congress, we can attempt to understand the impact running for president has on congressional activity.

## A Look at the Data
Using the [ProPublica Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/), I isolated the presidential candidates who were also in Congress and used different metrics to compare them as a group over time. Usually, I compare their presidential candidate selves to their past (and future) selves, as each of their habits are vastly different.

### Statements
Congressional statements, mainly in the form of press releases, are ways for congresspeople to communicate their opinions on bills or achievements to their constituents. These statements can get picked up by the media and potentially boost someone's image. ***research more***.
