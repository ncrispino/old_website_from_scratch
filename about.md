# About Me

I'm Nick, a rising college sophomore studying computer science and economics. I love computer science and math, but my real passion lies in economics and public policy. On this website, I'll be trying to answer some basic questions using the (limited) knowledge that I have. Nothing I write will be conclusive, but hopefully it'll be interesting and at the very least provoke some thought.

On a sidenote, I made this website from scratch. As you can probably see, it's  not my forte, but was worthwhile nonetheless; I encourage everyone to try it out, not only to create something (hopefully) beautiful, but to learn about the mysterious of the ubiquitous World Wide Web.
